This repo is used to store my solutions code and stats for leetcode's top 50 google interview questions https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-google-questions/

Each folder contains a solution.py file which contains just the solution, testcases.py which runs the solution with 3 example cases from leetcode (to be added), and README.md with the question and leetcode stats for the solution.
